                    This course is designed to help learners who study English language to be familiar with an important
                    area of language which is morphology. As part of the requirement, when a language learner studies a
                    language, they have to study knowledge of the language as well. Morphology, as the study of the
                    process of word-formation, is an important part of studying any language. This course starts with
                    basic definition of a morpheme and ends with covering the process of word formation. Types of
                    morphemes, their syntactic and semantic functions, the process of affixation, typ
                    es of affixes and
                    the process of word formation are among the topics to be covered in this course.
