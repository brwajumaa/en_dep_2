                    The course explores the study of literature is the study of human nature. Literature helps us
                    understand who we are and why we do what we do. In this class we will focus on the development
                    of
                    the short story, and novel genre with representative works from the 19th through 21st centuries,
                    we
                    will examine the elements of fiction (character, setting, characterization, point of view, plot,
                    tone, theme) in relation to meaning. This course serves as an introduction to the literary genre
                    of
                    fiction. It provides the basic literary and linguistic characteristics of the genre. This course
                    also provides information about the origin, history, and development of fiction. This course is
                    divided to two parts, firstly students will read a selection of short stories and clearly
                    examine
                    and analyze them in class to illustrate these characteristics. The second part, students will
                    read a
                    novel, examine, and analyze it. The course is primarily a discussion, based on studentsâ€™ close
                    reading and critical analysis of the stories and the selected novel. wide selection of important
                    Old, Middle Ages, Renaissance and Neoclassical poets and poems. The poems for critical analysis
                    include established works by well-known poets whose works express the quintessence of Old,
                    Middle,
                    Renaissance and Neoclassical culture and society. The poems start with Caedmon and Beowulf and
                    end
                    with the Neoclassical poetry. One perspective offered is that poetry offers intellectual, moral
                    and
                    linguistic pleasures as well as difficulties to our private lives as readers and to our public
                    lives
                    as writers. Expect to hear and read poems aloud and to memorize lines; the class format will be
                    group discussion, presentation, occasional lecture and the submission of essays and projects.
